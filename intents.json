&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. COVID-19 is the infectious
disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before
the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.&quot;

&quot;patterns&quot;: [
&quot;Can you catch COVID-19 by air?&quot;
],
&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected
person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or
surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-
19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your
hands.&quot;

&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All
available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-
CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically
related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations.
MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related.&quot;

&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;The &#39;incubation period&#39; means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of
the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly
around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.&quot;

&quot;Are antibiotics effective on COVID-19?&quot;,
&quot;Can I use antibiotics to treat COVID-19?&quot;
],
&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is
caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. &quot;

&quot;While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with

&quot;Should I worry about COVID-19?&quot;
],
&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However,
it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal
for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel
our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among
these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and
follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and
gatherings. Learn more about how to protect yourself at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-

],
&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
recover without requiring special treatment. People above 60, and those with underlying medical problems like
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
illness. Common symptoms include: fever; tiredness; and, dry cough. Other symptoms include: shortness of
breath; aches and pains; sore throat; and, sometimes, diarrhoea, nausea, or a runny nose.&quot;

&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: wash your hands
regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub; maintain at least 1 metre distance
between you and people coughing or sneezing; avoid touching your face; cover your mouth and nose when
coughing or sneezing; stay home if you feel unwell; refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the
lungs; and, practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of
people.&quot;

&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. While some western, traditional or home remedies
may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can
prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including
antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that
include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
clinical findings are available.&quot;

covid19&quot;],
&quot;responses&quot;: [
&quot;The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak
unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there
are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous
action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel,
movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or
spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in
China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of
the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation
worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-
reports/&quot;
